![alt_text](https://github.com/akirawisnu/GIS_Shapefile_2020_ID/blob/main/WhatsApp%20Image%202021-02-24%20at%2018.39.45.jpeg)

Updated GIS data (shapefiles) from Kemendagri DUKCAPIL Server (https://gis.dukcapil.kemendagri.go.id), they consist Province, District, Sub-District and Village level shapefile dataset. Feel free to use the file. 

Notes:
* The Geo ID is using DAGRI code, therefore will need to use concordance between BPS and DAGRI code. You can find the concordance under this link: https://sig-dev.bps.go.id/webgis/pencariankodenama

It consists information of:
* number of districts (jumlah_kab)
* number of sub-districts (jumlah_kec)
* number of village (jumlah_kel)
* population (jumlah_pen)
* family number (jumlah_kk)
* area (luas_wilay) in Km squared
* Population Density (kepadatan_)

Please use 7-zip Zstandard to un-compressed the file. This is the best compression format, and you all are missing out if not using it:
